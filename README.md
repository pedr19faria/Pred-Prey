# Predator-Prey Model

The files in the repository refers to the study of the Predator-Prey Model. The file "Pred-Prey.ipynb" investigates the system of differential equations which describes the Predator-Prey Model as put fourth by A. J. Lotka and V. Volterra in the 20th century. This is done by resolving the equations numerically and plotting the results. This is also done with the Realistic-Predator-Prey Model and a data analysis of the Lynx and Hare population -data made avaiable in the book "Fundamentals of Ecology" by Odum- which seems to supports the equations developed to model this type of interaction. The file "ABM_PredatorPrey.ipynb" seeks to develop a Agent Based Model to simulate the interaction between predator and prey, aiming to show that stochastically the system approaches the results found deterministically.
